# PUBG Macro All Weapon

This repository contains a simple C++ program that acts as a macro for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), specifically designed for all weapons. It is intended to reduce vertical recoil by adjusting mouse movement. 

## Usage

1. **DPI Setting**: Ensure your mouse DPI is set to 500.
2. **Trigger Key**: Press the `Numpad1` button to activate the macro.
3. **Activation**: Click the mouse button while the macro is activated to apply recoil reduction.
4. **Scope Recommendation**: The macro is more effective when using holo/red dot/2x scope/3x scope.

## How It Works

The program continuously monitors the state of the `Numpad1` key. When activated, it checks for mouse clicks. Upon detecting a click, it adjusts the mouse movement to reduce vertical recoil.
